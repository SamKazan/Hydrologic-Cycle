# Statistical Analysis on Factors Affecting Hydrologic Cycle

This project focuses on the factors affecting the hydrologic cycle, using statistical analysis to investigate the impact of Evapotranspiration, Temperature, Precipitation and Surface runoff. The project aims to uncover the relationships between these factors and the hydrologic cycle, providing a deeper understanding of how the environment affects continuous movement of water.
